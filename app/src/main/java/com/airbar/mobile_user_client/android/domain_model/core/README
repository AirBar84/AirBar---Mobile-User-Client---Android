Maybe call this elements/element....

Element, a core/root type similiar to Event, that has some shared properties and, more
importantly, has Record Modification Tracking...

RMT might not be a big deal on the Android Mobile Client but, I wanted to capture it here.
It will allow us to show account history and, really all change history for each Element
in the system.
